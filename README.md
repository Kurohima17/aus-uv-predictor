# aus-uv-predictor
I train a LSTM model (powered by Tensorflow Keras) to predict UV-index in Australian cities as part of an onboarding-project for unit FIT5120 Industry Experience.
This model can predict hourly UV-index for Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Sydney, and Canberra.

I'll probably deploy this model via Streamlit in a separate repo since the dataset is really large :)
